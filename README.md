### 🚀 Projects

Here are some of my key projects, demonstrating my skills in automation, backend development, and data analysis.

#### **Subota — AI Voice Assistant**
- **Tech Stack:** Python, OpenCV, YOLOv8, aiogram, SileroTTS, llama.cpp
- **Description:** A voice-controlled AI assistant with computer vision capabilities. It can detect humans, motion, and dangerous situations (e.g., a person with a weapon). Features include voice-controlled mathematical operations, integrations with a Telegram bot and email notifications, and an optimized voice output system.

#### **File_checker — Corporate Excel Parser**
- **Tech Stack:** Python, pandas, openpyxl, PyQt5
- **Description:** A GUI application developed for a client to automate Excel file processing. It automatically divides order canvases into tabs, generates up to 36 region-specific price lists, and assigns customs codes (UKTZD) to invoices. The project is compiled into a `.exe` file for easy use by end-users.

#### **OSBB_maintense — Housing & Communal Services Accounting System**
- **Tech Stack:** FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Argon2, Fernet, PyQt6
- **Description:** An accounting system with a FastAPI backend, designed to handle user authorization and data management with encrypted credentials. The client-side GUI is developed with PyQt6. The system is optimized for free hosting and will be integrated with a Telegram bot for meter readings and receipts.
