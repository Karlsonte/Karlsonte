# 👨‍💻 Python Developer

I'm a Python Developer with a strong background (10+ years) in analytics, process automation, and project management. Passionate about applying my problem-solving skills to backend development, I'm actively building projects to transition my career into the tech industry.

### 💡 Flagship Project: System Architecture & Reliability

This project demonstrates my highest-level skills in system design, asynchronous programming, and engineering maturity.

#### **Subota — Asynchronous Event-Driven Digital Butler** *[Project Link](https://github.com/Karlsonte/Subota-Multifunctional-Assistant/tree/main)*
- **Architecture:** **Asynchronous EDA** (FastAPI/asyncio, Redis Event Bus), PostgreSQL/Alembic, RBAC.
- **Key Skills Demonstrated:**
    1.  **Architectural Design:** Transitioned the project from a synchronous monolith to a scalable, **Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)** core, using Redis as the central communication bus.
    2.  **System Reliability:** Implemented **Health Checkers**, a **Task Watcher** for process monitoring, **Graceful Shutdown** sequences, and over **40 Pytest tests** (Unit & Integration).
    3.  **Complex Integration:** Unified multi-channel I/O (Voice, Telegram, Web UI) and managed integrations with Computer Vision (YOLOv8) and LLM frameworks.
    4.  **Security & DevOps:** Designed **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**, implemented JWT authentication, and scripted Docker/PostgreSQL backup/restore procedures.

### ⚙️ Other Notable Projects

These projects demonstrate proficiency across the full development lifecycle, including GUI design and data processing.

#### **File\_checker — Corporate Excel Parser (GUI Automation)**
- **Tech Stack:** Python, `pandas`, `openpyxl`, `PyQt5`.
- **Description:** A GUI application designed for corporate clients to automate complex Excel processing. It handles the parsing of order canvases, automatically generates up to 36 region-specific price lists, and assigns customs codes (UKTZD) to invoices. Delivered as a compiled `.exe` for end-user deployment.

#### **OSBB\_maintense — Accounting System Backend**
- **Tech Stack:** `FastAPI` (Backend), `SQLAlchemy`, `Argon2`, `Fernet`, `PyQt6` (Client GUI).
- **Description:** A full-stack accounting system for communal services. The FastAPI backend manages data via SQLAlchemy, featuring secure user authorization with **Argon2** password hashing and **Fernet** encryption for sensitive data. Designed for integration with external services (Telegram bot) for automated meter readings.
